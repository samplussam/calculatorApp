# Calculator App

The quintessential first app, like starting with "Hello World".

## The Project:

I decided to make a simple calculator app as my first application in flutter, as a way of learning how to use the software before moving onto more ambitious projects, inlcuding my current final year project. I am aiming to develop an object-focused note taking app for tabletop games. I am currently completing background research and learning.
